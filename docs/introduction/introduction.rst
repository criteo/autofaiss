Introduction
============

This lib creates quantized indices for similarity search on dense vectors.
Once the index is created with this library, you can use deepr_knn to deploy you index and use it through an API.


Installing the requirements
===========================

1. First, create a virtual environement with `python3 -m venv .venvs/quantization_env`
2. Then, activate it with `source .venvs/quantization_env/bin/activate`
3. Next, go to deepr_python/autofaiss with `cd` command
4. Finally, install autofaiss with `pip install -e .`

It is now possible to use the CLI commands and run the notebooks.
